    "\n",
    " The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a nonparametric problem in operations research and economics whose solution is an estimation of production frontiers. It is used to empirically measure the productive efficiency of decision making units (DMUs). There are a number of linear programming formulations of the DEA problem. Fuller coverage of the subject can be found in Farrell (1957), Charnes et al. (1978) and Thanassoulis et al. (1987). The formulation given by H.P. Williams is described in Land (1991). This formulation is the dual model of a model  commonly used that relies on finding weighted ratios of outputs to inputs. We will use the formulation that is commonly used and can be found in Cooper et al. (2007).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Envelopment Analysis has been used to evaluate the performance of many different kinds of entities engaged in many different activities, and in many different contexts in many different countries. Examples include the maintenance activities of U.S. Air Force bases in different geographic locations, or police forces in England and Wales as well as the performance of branch banks in Cyprus and Canada and the efficiency of universities in performing their education and research functions in the U.S., England and France. \n",
    "\n",
    "The DEA approach is concerned with evaluations of *efficiency*. The most common measure of efficiency takes the form of a ratio like the following one:\n",

    "## Model Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume there is a set of DMUs. Some common input and output items for each of these DMUs are selected as follows:\n",
    "1. Numerical data are available for each input and output, with the data assumed to be positive, for all DMUs.\n",
    "2. The items (inputs, outputs and choice of DMUs) should reflect an analyst's or a manager's interest in the components that will enter into the relative efficiency evaluations of the DMUs.\n",
    "3. In principle, smaller input amounts are preferable and larger output amounts are preferable so the efficiency scores should reflect these principles.\n",
    "4. The measurement units of the different inputs and outputs do not need to be congruent. Some may involve a number of persons, or areas of floor space, money expended, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fractional problem formulation\n",
    "The proposed measure of the efficiency of a target DMU $k$ is obtained as the maximum of a ratio of weighted outputs to weighted inputs subject to the condition that the similar ratios for every DMU be less than or equal to one.\n",
