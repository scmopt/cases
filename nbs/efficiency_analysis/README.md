# Efficiency Analysis 

This Efficiency Analysis model is an example of the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) problem, which is used to 
measure the productive efficiency of an organization.  The DEA Problem is formulated as a linear programming 
problem using the Gurobi Python API and solved with the Gurobi Optimizer.

This model is example 22 from the fifth edition of Model Building in Mathematical Programming by H. Paul Williams 
on pages 278-280 and 335-336.

This example is at the intermediate level where we assume that you know Python and the Gurobi Python API and that 
you have some knowledge of building mathematical optimization models.
